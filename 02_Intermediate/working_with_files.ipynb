    "### Reading from Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opening a File for Reading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To read data from a file, you first need to open the file in *read mode*. The basic function for this is `open()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_object = open(\"filename.txt\", \"r\") # \"r\" mode is for reading text files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`open(\"filename.txt\", \"r\")`**:  Opens the file named \"filename.txt\". The second argument `\"r\"` specifies the *file mode* as read mode for text files.\n",
    "*   **`file_object`**: The `open()` function returns a file object, which you can then use to interact with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading File Content:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the file is opened in read mode, you can use various methods to read its content:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`read()`**: Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "*   **`readline()`**: Reads a single line from the file (including the newline character at the end of the line).\n",
    "*   **`readlines()`**: Reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string is a line.\n",
    "*   **Iterating over the file object:** You can directly iterate over the file object in a `for` loop to read the file line by line, which is memory-efficient for large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closing the File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to *close* the file after you're done with it. This releases system resources and ensures that any changes are properly saved (though for reading, it's primarily about resource management). You close a file using the `close()` method of the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# File Handling - Reading from Text Files\n",

    "This is the second line.\n",
    "And this is the third line.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\")`**: Opens the file \"sample.txt\" for reading as text.\n",
    "*   **`file.read()`**: Reads the entire content as one string.\n",
    "*   **`file.readline()`**: Reads one line at a time.\n",
    "*   **`file.readlines()`**: Reads all lines into a list.\n",
    "*   **`for line in file:`**: Iterates through the file object, reading one line in each iteration. This is memory-efficient as it doesn't load the entire file into memory at once.\n",
    "*   **`file.close()`**:  Closes the file. It's important to close files to release resources. The `try-finally` block is used here to ensure the file is closed even if errors occur during reading.  However, context managers (covered later) provide a cleaner way to handle this.\n",

    "### Writing to Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opening a File for Writing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To write data to a file, you need to open it in *write mode* (`\"w\"`) or *append mode* (`\"a\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Write Mode (`\"w\"`):** If the file exists, write mode *truncates* (empties) the file first and then writes new data from the beginning. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "*   **Append Mode (`\"a\"`):** If the file exists, append mode *adds* new data to the end of the existing file content. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the file is opened in write or append mode, you can use the following methods to write data:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`write(string)`**: Writes the given string to the file.  Newline characters (`\\n`) need to be explicitly added to create new lines.\n",
    "*   **`writelines(list_of_strings)`**: Writes a list of strings to the file. It does *not* automatically add newline characters between strings; you need to include them in the strings themselves if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closing the File:**  Always remember to close the file after writing to ensure data is flushed to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# File Handling - Writing to Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Writing to a new file in write mode (\"w\") - creates a new file or overwrites existing\n",

    "*   **`open(\"output.txt\", \"w\")`**: Opens \"output.txt\" in write mode. If the file existed, its content would be erased before writing.\n",
    "*   **`file.write(...)`**: Writes strings to the file.  `\\n` is used to insert newline characters for line breaks.\n",
    "*   **`open(\"output.txt\", \"a\")`**: Opens \"output.txt\" in append mode. New data is added at the end of the existing content.\n",

    "### File Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen `\"r\"`, `\"w\"`, and `\"a\"` for text file reading, writing, and appending. Here's a summary of common file modes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description                                                                 |\n",
    "|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `\"r\"`  | Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading. Error if file does not exist. |\n",
    "| `\"w\"`  | Write mode. Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the file if it exists. |\n",
    "| `\"a\"`  | Append mode. Opens the file for writing, appending to the end if the file exists. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist. |\n",
    "| `\"x\"`  | Exclusive creation mode. Opens for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists. |\n",
    "| `\"b\"`  | Binary mode. Used to handle binary files (e.g., images, audio). Should be combined with other modes (e.g., `\"rb\"`, `\"wb\"`). |\n",
    "| `\"t\"`  | Text mode (default). Handles text files, encoding/decoding based on platform defaults or specified encoding. |\n",
    "| `\"+\"`  | Update mode (reading and writing). Should be combined with other modes (e.g., `\"r+\"`, `\"w+\"`, `\"a+\"`). |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Combinations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`\"rt\"` or `\"r\"`**: Read text (default).\n",
    "*   **`\"wt\"` or `\"w\"`**: Write text (truncate if exists).\n",
    "*   **`\"at\"` or `\"a\"`**: Append text.\n",
    "*   **`\"rb\"`**: Read binary.\n",
    "*   **`\"wb\"`**: Write binary.\n",
    "*   **`\"ab\"`**: Append binary.\n",
    "*   **`\"r+\"`**: Read and write (file pointer at the beginning).\n",
    "*   **`\"w+\"`**: Write and read (truncates the file).\n",
    "*   **`\"a+\"`**: Append and read (file pointer at the end for writing, but can read from anywhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Examples (Illustrating different modes):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# File Modes Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Read Binary mode (\"rb\") - for non-text files (example: reading image - conceptually)\n",

    "### Context Managers (`with open(...) as ...:`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using context managers with the `with open(...) as file:` statement is the *recommended* way to work with files in Python. It ensures that files are automatically closed properly, even if errors occur. This makes your code cleaner, safer, and less prone to resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"filename.txt\", \"mode\") as file_object:\n",
    "    # Code block to work with the file (read or write operations)\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "# File is automatically closed when you exit the 'with' block (indentation level)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Context Managers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Automatic File Closing:** The file is guaranteed to be closed automatically when the `with` block is exited, regardless of whether errors occurred within the block.\n",
    "*   **Cleaner Code:**  Reduces boilerplate code for `try-finally` blocks for file closing.\n",
    "*   **Resource Management:** Ensures proper release of system resources associated with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Examples (using context managers):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# File Handling - Context Managers (with open(...) as ...:)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Reading from a file using 'with' statement\n",
    "with open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(\"--- File content using 'with' and read() ---\")\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "# File is automatically closed here\n",

    "# 2. Writing to a file using 'with' statement\n",
    "with open(\"output_with.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"This line is written using 'with' statement.\\n\")\n",
    "    file.write(\"Another line.\\n\")\n",
    "    print(\"Data written to output_with.txt using 'with' statement.\")\n",
    "# File is automatically closed here\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Appending to a file using 'with' statement\n",

    "    for line in file:\n",
    "        print(\"Line:\", line, end='')\n",
    "# File is automatically closed here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`with open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\") as file:`**: Opens \"sample.txt\" in read mode and assigns the file object to the variable `file`. The code within the indented block can then operate on `file`.\n",
    "*   **Automatic Closing:** When the `with` block finishes (either by reaching the end or due to an error), Python automatically takes care of closing the file. You don't need to explicitly call `file.close()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with CSV Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are a common format for storing tabular data. Python's `csv` module in the standard library is designed for working with CSV files.\n",

    "Bob,35,London\n",
    "Charlie,22,Paris\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing CSV Files:**\n",
    "\n",

    "    print(\"Data written to output_data.csv in CSV format.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation (CSV Handling):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`import csv`**: Imports the `csv` module.\n",
    "*   **`csv.reader(csvfile)`**: Creates a reader object to parse CSV data from the file.\n",
    "*   **`next(csv_reader)`**: Reads the first row (header row) and advances the reader to the next row.\n",
    "*   **Iteration:** You can iterate over the `csv_reader` to get each row as a list of strings (fields).\n",
    "*   **`csv.writer(csvfile)`**: Creates a writer object to write data to a CSV file.\n",
    "*   **`csv_writer.writerows(data_to_write)`**: Writes a list of lists (where each inner list is a row) to the CSV file.\n",
    "*   **`newline=''`**:  Important to include `newline=''` when opening CSV files, especially on Windows, to prevent extra blank rows in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the Python File Handling Refresher section. Using context managers (`with open(...) as ...:`) is highly recommended for clean and safe file operations. Practice reading and writing both text and CSV files using different modes and context managers to become comfortable with file handling in Python.\n"
