    "\n",

    "### Importing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Modules?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. These definitions can be functions, classes, and variables. Modules are used to organize code into logical units, making it more manageable and reusable. They also help to avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use Modules?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Code Organization:** Break down large programs into smaller, manageable files.\n",
    "*   **Reusability:** Use functions and classes defined in one module in other parts of your code or in different projects.\n",
    "*   **Namespace Management:** Modules create separate namespaces, preventing name clashes between different parts of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing Modules in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several ways to import modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`import module_name`**: Imports the entire module. You then access items within the module using the module name as a prefix (e.g., `module_name.item_name`).\n",
    "2.  **`from module_name import item_name`**: Imports specific items (functions, classes, variables) from a module directly into the current namespace. You can then use these items without the module name prefix. You can import multiple items using commas: `from module_name import item1, item2, item3`.\n",
    "3.  **`import module_name as alias`**: Imports the entire module but gives it a shorter or more convenient alias. This is useful when module names are long or to avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Examples:**"

    "### Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Python Standard Library?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library is a vast collection of modules that comes with every Python installation. These modules provide a wide range of pre-built functionalities for common programming tasks. It's often described as \"batteries included\" because you have a lot of useful tools available right out of the box without needing to install anything extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of using the Standard Library:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Ready to Use:** Modules are already installed with Python.\n",
    "*   **Well-Tested and Reliable:** Standard library modules are generally well-maintained, thoroughly tested, and reliable.\n",
    "*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Many standard library modules are designed to work consistently across different operating systems.\n",
    "*   **Saves Development Time:** Reusing existing code from the standard library saves you from writing code from scratch for common tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Useful Standard Library Modules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore a few commonly used modules from the standard library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`math` Module:** Provides mathematical functions (as seen in the previous example).\n",
    "2.  **`datetime` Module:** For working with dates and times.\n",
    "3.  **`os` Module:**  Provides functions for interacting with the operating system (e.g., file system operations).\n",
    "4.  **`sys` Module:** Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.\n",

    "### Installing and Using External Packages with `pip` and `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are External Packages (Libraries)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Python Standard Library is extensive, there are many specialized tasks and functionalities that are not included. External packages (also often called libraries or third-party packages) are created by the Python community to extend Python's capabilities for specific domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of popular external packages (relevant to your MSc course):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`pandas`**: For data analysis and manipulation (data structures like DataFrames).\n",
    "*   **`numpy`**: For numerical computing (arrays, mathematical functions).\n",
    "*   **`scikit-learn`**: For machine learning algorithms and tools.\n",
    "*   **`matplotlib`**, **`seaborn`**, **`plotly`**: For data visualization.\n",
    "*   **`requests`**: For making HTTP requests (web interaction).\n",
    "*   **`SQLAlchemy`**, **`psycopg2`**, **`pymysql`**, **`pymongo`**: For database interaction.\n",
    "*   **`pyspark`**: For working with Apache Spark for big data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Package Managers: `pip` and `conda`**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install and manage external packages, Python uses package managers. The two most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`pip` (Pip Installs Packages):** The default package installer for Python. It's usually included with Python installations. `pip` primarily installs packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI - [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/)).\n",
    "*   **`conda` (Conda Package and Environment Manager):** An open-source package and environment management system. `conda` is often used in data science and scientific computing. It can manage packages not only for Python but also for other languages and system-level libraries. `conda` packages are often obtained from Anaconda repositories or conda-forge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `pip`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Installation (if not already installed):** `pip` is generally included with Python 3. If not, you might need to install it separately based on your OS.\n",
    "2.  **Installing a package:** Open your terminal or command prompt and use the command:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install package_name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Replace `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install (e.g., `pip install pandas`).\n",
    "3.  **Uninstalling a package:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip uninstall package_name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4.  **Listing installed packages:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip list\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5.  **Upgrading a package:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install --upgrade package_name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `conda`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Installation:** `conda` is typically installed by installing Anaconda or Miniconda distributions ([https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)).\n",
    "2.  **Creating a conda environment (recommended):** It's best practice to create separate environments for different projects to manage dependencies.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda create --name myenv python=3.9  # Create an environment named 'myenv' with Python 3.9\n",
    "    conda activate myenv                  # Activate the environment\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Installing a package within an environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda install package_name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (e.g., `conda install pandas`)\n",
    "4.  **Uninstalling a package:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda uninstall package_name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5.  **Listing installed packages in the current environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda list\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "6.  **Deactivating an environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda deactivate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "7.  **Listing all conda environments:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda env list\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example (using external package - pandas):**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you have `pandas` installed. If not, in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "```bash\n",
