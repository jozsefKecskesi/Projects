    "**Data Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Python infers the type based on the value assigned.  Here are the fundamental data types we'll cover:\n",

    "*   **Integers (int):** Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimal points.\n",
    "*   **Floats (float):** Numbers with decimal points.\n",
    "*   **Strings (str):** Sequences of characters, used to represent text. Enclosed in single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`\"...\"`).\n",
    "*   **Booleans (bool):** Represent truth values, either `True` or `False`.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Sets are created using curly braces `{}`, or by using the `set()` constructor (e.g., `set([1, 2, 3])`).\n",
    "*   Sets automatically handle uniqueness; duplicate elements are discarded.\n",
    "*   Sets are mutable, but elements within a set must be immutable.\n",
    "*   Key set operations like union, intersection, difference, subset, superset are very useful and efficient for tasks involving unique collections and relationships between them.\n",
