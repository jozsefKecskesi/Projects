    "## SQLite in Python - A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It's a popular choice for embedded systems, mobile applications, and desktop software due to its simplicity and portability.  Python's built-in `sqlite3` module provides a straightforward interface for interacting with SQLite databases.\n",
