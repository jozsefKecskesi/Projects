    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Learn to interact with databases (both SQL and NoSQL) using Python.\n",

    "**Module 1: SQL Fundamentals**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1.1) Basic SQL Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases.  Here's a breakdown of core commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`SELECT`**: Retrieves data from one or more tables.\n",
    "*   **`FROM`**: Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from.\n",
    "*   **`WHERE`**: Filters the results based on a condition.\n",
    "*   **`ORDER BY`**: Sorts the results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.\n",
    "*   **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows with the same values in specified columns.\n",
    "*   **`JOIN`**: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.  Common types include `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.\n",
    "*   **`INSERT INTO`**: Adds new rows to a table.\n",
    "*   **`UPDATE`**: Modifies existing rows in a table.\n",
    "*   **`DELETE FROM`**: Removes rows from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Conceptual -  assume a table named `users` with columns `id`, `name`, `age`, `city`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Select all columns and rows from the 'users' table\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Select only the 'name' and 'age' columns\n",
    "SELECT name, age FROM users;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Select users older than 25\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Select users from 'New York', ordered by name\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE city = 'New York' ORDER BY name ASC;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Count users in each city\n",
    "SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS user_count FROM users GROUP BY city;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- (Assuming a 'orders' table with 'user_id' and 'order_date')\n",
    "-- Join users and orders to get user names and their order dates\n",
    "SELECT users.name, orders.order_date\n",
    "FROM users\n",
    "INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert a new user\n",
    "INSERT INTO users (name, age, city) VALUES ('Alice', 30, 'London');\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Update Alice's age\n",
    "UPDATE users SET age = 31 WHERE name = 'Alice';\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Relational Databases (SQL):**\n",
    "    *   Data is organized into tables with rows (records) and columns (fields).\n",
    "    *   Relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys.\n",
    "    *   Examples:  MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "    *   Use SQL for querying and managing data.\n",
    "    *   ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are often emphasized.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "    *   \"Not Only SQL\" - a broad category of databases that don't adhere to the strict relational model.\n",
    "    *   Various data models:\n",
    "        *   **Document databases** (e.g., MongoDB): Store data in JSON-like documents.\n",
    "        *   **Key-value stores** (e.g., Redis):  Store data as key-value pairs.\n",
    "        *   **Wide-column stores** (e.g., Cassandra):  Store data in flexible columns.\n",
    "        *   **Graph databases** (e.g., Neo4j):  Store data as nodes and relationships.\n",
    "    *   Often prioritize scalability and flexibility over strict consistency.\n",
    "    *   May use different query languages or APIs.\n",

    "*   **Error Handling:**  Real-world applications should include robust error handling (try-except blocks) to gracefully handle database connection issues, query errors, etc.\n",
    "*   **Transactions:**  For operations that involve multiple steps (e.g., transferring money between accounts), use transactions to ensure that all steps either succeed or fail together (atomicity).\n",

    "An ORM is a library that maps database tables to Python objects.  This allows you to interact with the database using object-oriented programming instead of writing raw SQL.\n",

    "**(4.2) Benefits and Drawbacks of Using ORMs**\n",

    "*   **Benefits:**\n",
    "    *   **Abstraction:**  You work with objects and methods, hiding the underlying SQL.\n",
    "    *   **Code Reusability:**  Define your models once and reuse them throughout your application.\n",
    "    *   **Database Portability:**  Switching between different database systems (e.g., SQLite to PostgreSQL) can be easier.\n",
    "    *   **Security:** ORMs often provide built-in protection against SQL injection.\n",
    "*   **Drawbacks:**\n",
    "    *   **Learning Curve:**  You need to learn the ORM's API.\n",
    "    *   **Performance Overhead:**  In some cases, ORMs can be slower than carefully optimized raw SQL.\n",
    "    *   **Complexity:**  For very complex queries, ORMs can become cumbersome.\n",
